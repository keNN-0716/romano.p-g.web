        <h3>Modern Clothing Styles in 2025</h3>

          <p>
            Designers this season encouraged a willing suspension of disbelief, meaning an openness to a sense of wonder – and not 
            just when it came to the clothes. At Bottega Veneta, chairs were magicked into squishy creatures, and backstage Matthieu 
            Blazy showcased a copy of Richard Scarry’s Biggest Word Book Ever with a custom intrecciato cover. Scarry’s Busy, Busy 
            World and What Do People Do All Day?

            Would’ve been equally apropos for a season in which many shows celebrated 
        individuality, rather than showcasing a narrative through-line. That’s also how the world works in Busy Town, where the reader 
        is introduced to all manner of folk – their jobs, attire, and accoutrements (pickle car, anyone?) – going about their business 
        with more or less fnesse. And don’t tell me there is no connection between Lowly Worm and Blazy’s one-legged pants! 
        Skousers and skorts were news this season.
