        <h3>Kendal Jenner's Styles</h3>

          <p>
            Kendall Jenner was frst thrust into the public eye 16 
        years ago, as the quiet, tomboyish 11-year-old younger 
        sister on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. But in 
        2014, the second-youngest member of the Kar-Jenner 
        dynasty struck out to forge her own path as a model. 
        Since her runway debut for Marc Jacobs’ fall 2014 show,
        Jenner has become a ubiquitous presence, not only on 
        our TV screens, but on the runway and in magazines, 
        too. With such a jam-packed schedule, the budding 
        model became a regular street style subject, as she 
        bounced from show to show.

            Early photos captured Jenner’s style at the beginning of 
        its evolution. Even at 19, she shows the same fashion 
        DNA that she has today: a love of simplicity. As she’s 
        become more entrenched in the fashion world, Jenner’s 
        interest in fashion history broadened, as well as her 
        wardrobe. These days, whether she’s rocking head-to-toe
        The Row, showing of her latest Phoebe Philo purchase, 
        or pulling from her Alaïa archive, she’s become one of our
        favorite street style stars.
